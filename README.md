# STOCK: Inventory Management & Mobile Scanner

> **System Overview:** This project is a dual-platform inventory solution. It consists of a **Web Dashboard** (STOCK) for managing batches and generating QR codes, and a companion **Android App** (STOCKQR) used to scan those codes and update stock quantities in real-time.

## 🌐 Part 1: The Web Dashboard (STOCK)
The central hub for tracking inventory. This web application allows users to add items, manage specific batches, and generate the QR codes required for the mobile app.

### Key Features
* **Batch-Level Inventory:** Tracks stock by individual batches and expiration dates rather than just total counts.
* **QR Code Generation:** Automatically creates and prints QR labels for specific stock batches.
* **Safety Workflow:** Features a "Holding Area" where stock-out transactions must be confirmed before final deduction.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and tablet viewing.

### Tech Stack (Web)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla).
* **Backend (Original):** PHP & MySQL (Note: The repository currently contains the static frontend demo).

## 📱 Part 2: The Mobile Scanner (StockQR)
A native Android application designed to bridge the physical inventory with the digital database.

### How It Works
1.  The user scans a QR code generated by the **STOCK** dashboard.
2.  The app detects the embedded URL within the QR code.
3.  It automatically redirects the user to the specific "Edit Quantity" page on the STOCK website, allowing for immediate inventory updates.

### Key Features
* **Fast Scanning:** Utilizes the ZXing library for instant barcode and QR recognition.
* **Flashlight Support:** Integrated "Volume Up" trigger to toggle the flashlight for dark warehouse environments.

### Tech Stack (Mobile)
* **Language:** Java
* **Framework:** Android SDK (Target API 31).
* **Library:** `zxing-android-embedded` for scanning.

## 🚀 How to Run the System

### Running the Website
1.  **Clone** the repository.
2.  Navigate to the `Stock Inventory/` folder.
3.  Open `login.html` in any web browser to view the static prototype.
    * *Note: For full database functionality, this needs to be deployed on a PHP/MySQL server (e.g., XAMPP).*

### Running the Android App
1.  Open the `StockQR` folder in **Android Studio**.
2.  Sync Gradle files to download the ZXing dependencies.
3.  Connect an Android device via USB.
4.  Run the application.
5.  **Usage:** Point the camera at a QR code generated by the website. If the QR contains a link, the app will ask to open it to update the stock.
